# Automatic-traffic-light-system

## Introduction
This project was created using C language with Keil as the compiler and AT89C51 simulation as the microprocessor. This project uses lcd display for showing the traffic signs and three led-aquas for interfacing the traffic lights at an interval of 5 secs. The time can be suitably changed for real-world applications. This is a low-cost automatic traffic light system that was made to practice and subsequently hone my skills in 8051.

## Working Principle
This is an automatic traffic light system that has a time interval of 5 secs between each lights as well as describe the messages on the led. Although the idea of displaying messages on the lcd may seem unnecessary but many colorblind drivers are often said to have come across problems with identifying the lights. Hence I thought that displaying messages on the lcd would be more feasible.
